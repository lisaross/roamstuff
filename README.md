## Styles

Quick and dirty: to keep it simple, I've separated the style types into individual css files in this repo.

And here are my work specific ones in case you want to customize them for your own use case:

I like to highlight items that are personal in nature (cottage, kids, yard work, etc) so having tags to do that (and filter out) is great.

Sometimes I want everything front and center, AND also want to be able to visually separate the contexts. I added a different tag color to those personal-type tags and put in a subtle background color to any block with that tag.

Note: for the Zettelkasten styles to work you need to make sure the note itself is surrounded by brackets (this is common practice: to keep the note atomic you make the thought the title of the page)

Like so:
`#[[Permanent Notes]] [[This is a permanent note, which is now also a page]]`

Zettelkastens are complicated for the beginner (and the advanced, frankly, if you spend too much time tooling it). If you aren't sure what I'm talking about, here's a robust intro for you: https://www.thrivinghenry.com/writings/roamkasten-a-practical-how-to-guide-to-optimize-zettelkasten-in-roam-research

## Alfred Snippets

I've done a quick export of the Alfredapp snippets I use on the daily to type quickly in @Roamresearch. Feel free to use, just beware if you have any conflicts with your existing snippets.

## Readwise Templates - Roam Export

Thanks to [[RoamStack]] for his [inspiration here](https://roamstack.com/feed-roam-using-readwise/), creating templates for Readwise that pull good metadata into Roam Research for books, articles and other resources funnelled through their service.

Readwise can pull highlights and notes in from multiple services. I use the following integrations:
- Books highlights and notes: Amazon Kindle
- Highlights and annotations (pdf and web via Chrome Desktop): Memex
- Read Later highlights and notes: Instapaper
- Article highlights: Medium
- Newsletter highlights: Matter
- Highlights and notes on RSS Feeds and Youtube Subscriptions: Inoreader
- Highlights and notes on iOS: Command Browser
- Twitter posts and threads
- Key highlights of podcasts: Airr

Readwise also allows imports from more manual sources like:
- OCR (via mobile app)
- PDF
- Email
- Freeform input

### Installation

Head to the [Roam Export](https://readwise.io/export/roam/preferences) config page and paste the specific templates into their areas. Documentation sprinkles the page throughout in case you want to learn more or customize to your needs.

## Disclaimer

Note: I use this personally and I haven't done any accessibility, cross browser or cross platform testing. I'm on a Mac, using Chrome 94.0.4606.61 and a bunch of Roam js. I also use the [Roam Toolkit](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/roam-toolkit/ebckolanhdjilblnkcgcgifaikppnhba) chrome plugin. No guarantees that this will work in your environment, though it's been pretty stable for me so far.
