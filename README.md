## Styles

Quick and dirty: to keep it simple, I've separated the style types into individual css files in this repo.

And here are my work specific ones in case you want to customize them for your own use case:

## Alfred Snippets

I've done a quick export of the Alfredapp snippets I use on the daily to type quickly in @Roamresearch. Feel free to use, just beware if you have any conflicts with your existing snippets.

### Disclaimer
Note: I use this personally and I haven't done any accessibility, cross browser or cross platform testing. I'm on a Mac, using Chrome 94.0.4606.61 and a bunch of Roam js. I also use the [Roam Toolkit](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/roam-toolkit/ebckolanhdjilblnkcgcgifaikppnhba) chrome plugin. No guarantees that this will work in your environment, though it's been pretty stable for me so far.

### Collaboration and PRs
Please feel free to drop me a bug or a PR if you want to collab on this. ✌️
