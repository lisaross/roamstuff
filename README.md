# Nerdy Broad @RoamResearch Styles

Quick and dirty: to keep it simple, I've separated the style types into individual css files in this repo.

Here's what they look like on my machine.

Note: I use this personally and I haven't done any accessibility, cross browser or cross platform testing. I'm on a Mac, using Chrome 94.0.4606.61 and a bunch of Roam js. I also use the [Roam Toolkit](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/roam-toolkit/ebckolanhdjilblnkcgcgifaikppnhba) chrome plugin. No guarantees that this will work in your environment, though it's been pretty stable for me so far.

Please feel free to drop me a bug or a PR if you want to collab on this. ✌️
